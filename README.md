# Time-series-and-volatility-analysis-on-Nasdaq100-with-ARIMAGARCH-approach-and-Markov-switching-approach
• Main goal: explain the behaviour of financial time series and the relationship between returns and conditional volatility.
• Verify if ARIMA and GARCH processes provide parsimonious approximations to mean and volatility dynamics
• Build a more advanced model: MRS-GARCH and check if it provides a more powerful tool in modelling the series’ volatility than the traditional volatility models

## this is my personal bachelor's thesis
